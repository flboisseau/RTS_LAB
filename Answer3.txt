I could mention something about OpenEdge ABL, but you are most likely not familiar with that.  So I will say something about Java that I have a hard time dealing with.  That is "null", they seem to always catch me up, and I have a hard time remembering to check for them.  I understand why things fail, that since the object has not been created yet you are unable to access the methods and features in it.  I just wish when I forget to set it or get a null value in a call, there was a cleaner fail when I access it.  Everything I had dealt with before, a condition like that would have been caught at compile time or you would get an unexpected result.
